This project is a very simple calculator application made as an assignment for TDT4102

## Features
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Built using the course's graphical library.
   - Includes buttons for numbers, operators, and special actions (e.g., clear, history).

2. **Inheritance**:
   - A custom `CalculatorWindow` class inherits from `AnimationWindow` to manage the calculator's layout and functionality.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - Handles invalid equations and division by zero using `try-catch` blocks.

4. **File Handling**:
   - Saves calculation history to a file (`history.txt`).
   - Retrieves the last equation from the history file.

5. **Modular Design**:
   - Code is organized into multiple files for better readability and maintainability.


**NOTE**
After you have typed in an equation, and recieved the answer after pressing the `=`sign, remember to press `C`and clear the text field before starting your next calculation.
